This project centered around the creation of a custom dataset specifically tailored to Pakistani cows. This dataset includes 12 key-points on the cow's body, such as the nose, eyes, neck, feet, backbone, and tail root. Additionally, we compiled a breed dataset of Pakistani cows and utilized YOLO to train our model, enabling accurate identification and analysis. We also integrated custom image captioning techniques to perform detailed structural analysis.

Project Scope:
This project has vast potential and can be utilized in various ways:

Cattle Trading Guide: Our system can serve as a guiding tool for cattle trading, providing insights based on the physical characteristics of the cows.

E-commerce Integration: With minimal adaptation, our project could be integrated into E-commerce platforms like farmGhar, enabling transparent advertisement for cattle trading.

Cattle Farm Activity Analysis: With further development, our system could be used as a farm activity analyzer, helping farmers increase productivity, even in their absence.
